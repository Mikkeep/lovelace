    ulimit to achieve the same result. However, this command had to be included

    actual command line after the ulimit and a semicolon. This also required

    Use SIGSTOP and SIGKILL signals to clean up any remaining processes. In
    order to prevent a perpetual fork bomb, a simple SIGKILL is not enough â€“
    a single SIGKILL will reliably kill _one_ process, which will leave room
    for the other processes to spawn more processes, resulting in a neverending
    SIGKILL whack-a-mole. By using SIGSTOP first to freeze the forking
    processes and KILLing them after that, the fork bomb clean up should be
    more reliable.

    Neither SIGKILL nor SIGSTOP can be captured or blocked by any process.

          the real or saved UID of the receiving process.[1]
