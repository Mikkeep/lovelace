TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If the file uploads stop working for file names that have non-ASCII characters
in them and Django returns a UnicodeEncodeError response tracing back to
os.stat, you should check that your Apache configuration has UTF-8 as the file
system encoding.

(Referring to https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/deployment/modpython/#if-you-get-a-unicodeencodeerror)

On RHEL based distributions, edit
    /etc/sysconfig/httpd
and on Debian based distributions, edit
    /etc/apache2/envvars

Add the following lines to the file you edited:
export LANG='en_US.UTF-8'
export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

and restart Apache.
('/etc/init.d/httpd restart' seems to work if 'apachectl restart' doesn't.)
